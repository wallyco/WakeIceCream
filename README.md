## Wake Ice Cream Application Overview
- This project will create software for the Ice Cream Shop to track inventory of ice cream flavors and toppings to reduce labor cost and increase profit.
- Admin will be able to access the inventory system to check in items when replenishing inventory. Admin will also be able to make manual changes when running an audit on inventory to ensure digital inventory matches physical inventory.
- Software will also have the ability to be used as a POS (Point of Sale) System in which regular users can create transactions between users and customers.
- The software will also act as a portal in which employees can clock in and out and track hours worked.
- Admin will also have the ability to access inventory, sales, work hours, and expenses remotely via browser.
